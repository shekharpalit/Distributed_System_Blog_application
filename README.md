# Distributed System Blog application 

The goal of this project is to design and develop a scalable distributed system blog application (replication of twitter) using tuplespace and heterogeneous .


## Distributed Nodes 
There are 2 nodes in the network, one act as client (written in python) and one act as server, which is a tuple space in the network (written in Ruby).

- In version 1.0 of this project, we implemented the adapter pattern in RUBY, which is internally connected to the RInda tuple space.

- This architecture can also be implemented in python tuplespace, While our concerns are:
  - The PyLinda package is not not the same as the pylinda package available on PyPI.
  - PyLinda was written for Python 2.
  - The available code for PyLinda is missing some source files.
  - The original author of the code seems to have disappeared from the Internet.

- Fortunately Ruby, another common scripting language, includes a module named Rinda which implements the Linda distributed computing paradigm.
